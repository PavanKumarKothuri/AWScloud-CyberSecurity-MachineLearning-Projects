### README.md for Phishing Email Detector

# Phishing Email Detector

A simple tool to identify phishing emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). This project demonstrates how to analyze email content and classify it as either phishing or legitimate.

---

## Features
- **Email Content Analysis**: Uses text preprocessing and vectorization to extract features from email text.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Employs a Naive Bayes classifier for phishing detection.
- **Real-Time Testing**: Classify new emails as phishing or legitimate.
- **Easy-to-Extend**: Add new features like domain analysis or advanced ML models.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
  - [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
  - Pandas

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phishing-detector.git
   cd phishing-detector
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python phishing_detector.py
   ```

2. Test the model with new emails:
   - Add your email content in the `new_emails` list in the script.
   - Run the script to see classification results.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Accuracy: 1.0
Classification Report:
               precision    recall  f1-score   support
           0       1.00      1.00      1.00         1
           1       1.00      1.00      1.00         1

Email: Congratulations, you won $10,000! Click to claim. --> Phishing
Email: Don't miss our meeting tomorrow at 10 AM. --> Legitimate
```

---

## Roadmap for Improvements
- **Header Analysis**: Analyze `From`, `Subject`, and other email headers.
- **Domain Reputation**: Identify suspicious or unverified domains.
- **Deployment**: Create a web-based phishing detector using Flask or Streamlit.
- **Larger Dataset**: Use real-world email datasets for better accuracy.
